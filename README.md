# burak-yuksel

This repository contains the source code and content for my personal professional website.

The site serves as:
- My online CV
- A timeline of my career and experience
- A blog for long-form writing on topics such as delivery, leadership, and engineering
- A central hub linking to my GitHub and professional profiles

The website is intentionally designed to be:
- Clean and minimal
- Fully static
- Fast, accessible, and responsive
- Easy to maintain over time

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Astro** — static site generation
- **Markdown** — blog content
- **JSON** — structured CV timeline data
- **CSS + JavaScript** — styling and interaction
- **GSAP** — animations and scroll-based effects
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting and deployment

No backend, database, or authentication is used.

---

## 📂 Project Structure (High Level)

- `/src/pages` — site pages (home, CV, blog)
- `/src/components` — reusable UI components
- `/src/content/blog` — blog posts written in Markdown
- `/src/content/timeline.json` — CV timeline data
- `/public` — static assets (including downloadable CV PDF)

---

## ✍️ Writing & Publishing

Blog posts are written as Markdown files with metadata (title, date, tags, read time).  
Publishing a new article is as simple as adding a new file and pushing to the repository.

The CV timeline is driven from structured data, allowing updates without touching layout code.

## Commands
- `npm install` — install dependencies
- `npm run dev` — start local dev server at `http://localhost:4321`
- `npm run build` — build the static site to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally

---

## GitHub Pages Setup
1. Update `site` and `base` in `astro.config.mjs` to match your repo. Example for a repo named `burak-yuksel`:  
   ```js
   export default defineConfig({
     site: 'https://<your-username>.github.io/burak-yuksel',
     base: '/burak-yuksel/',
     output: 'static',
   });
   ```
2. Build the site: `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/`).
3. Deploy `dist/` to GitHub Pages (e.g., push with a `gh-pages` branch or configure Pages to serve from `dist` via GitHub Actions).

Markdown posts live in `src/content/blog`. Frontmatter is validated by the schema in `src/content/config.ts`, and the routes are generated statically for GitHub Pages-friendly hosting.

## 📌 Notes

- This is a personal, professional project.
- The design and animations are intentionally opinionated.
- Content reflects my own experience and views.

---

## 📌 Future Implementation / Post Ideas

- Notify users of a new blog post. Subscription system.
- Add a share function to the blog posts. So someone can share the post. When clicked on it will take the user to the specific post that was shared.
- Future post: Talk about the importance of coming prepared to a meeting as a Technical Program Manager. This differentiates "oh not another meeting" to "Oh this was a great meeting and a good use of everyones time". Current project at work I supported bringing technical leads to one call. Talked over the technical elements and drew up an action plan for all to follow-up on.
